## People who bought also bought ... That is what Association Rule Learning will help us figure out!

# Problem Statement
__we want to find out the association rules of the different products of a grocery store to see how the manager of this store can optimize the placement of its different products to optimize the sales  
The manager noticed and calculated that on average each customer goes and buys something to the store once a week, our dataset contains 7500 transcations of all the different customers that bought a basket of products in a whole week  
Each observation or row in the dataset corresponds to a specific customer who bought a specific bakset of product__
