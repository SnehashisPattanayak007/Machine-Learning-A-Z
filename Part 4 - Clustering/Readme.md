# Clustering in python 

## Problem Statement

__There is a big mall in a specific city that contains information of its clients, the clients that subscribe to the membership card when the client subscribe to the card they provided their information like their gender, age, and annual income,  
and because they have this card they use it to buy all sorts of things in the mall therefore the mall has the purchase history of each of its client member and that's how they obtained the last column in the dataset which is a spending score  
Spending score is a score that the mall computed for each of its clients based on several criteria including for eg. their income , the no of times per week they show up in the mall and of course the amount of dollars they spent in a year and based on all this they computed this metric that takes value b/w 1 and 100  
And eventually after collecting this dataset the company hired you as a machine learning scientist to segment their clients into differernt groups based on the annual income and the spending score and since the mall has no idea of what this client segments might be or even has no idea about how many segments there would be therefore this is typically a clustering problem becaue we don't know the answers__
